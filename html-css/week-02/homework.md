# Homework

1. (Est. 1-2 hours) Complete the "Common Responsive Patterns" lesson of the [Responsive Web Design Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-web-design-fundamentals--ud893) course.
2. (Est. 1-2 hours) Complete as many levels of the [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) game as you can. This will stretch your knowledge of Flexbox and you may need to do some research. It's ok if you can't complete all levels. Do as many as you can.
3. (Est. 3 hours) Complete as many levels as you can from [Flexbox Zombies](http://flexboxzombies.com/)
4. (Est. 2-3 hours) Continue working on the webpage you created in last week's homework assignment. Add a sidebar to your site and move the site description into it. When viewing on a small screen, this should appear below the articles. On a larger screen, it should switch to a two-column layout with the articles and sidebar sitting side-by-side. Add at least three more articles and then convert them to a grid, so that you show 3 articles per row in a box layout.
5. (Est. 1-2 hours) Flexbox is relatively new and is not supported in older browsers. In most of your work, you'll use Flexbox. But an employer might want you to use one of the older layout strategies. Read this article to learn about [positioning content in CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/) using floats and absolute positioning.

# Prepare for the next class

1. (Est. 1 hour) You may remember Bootstrap from your application process. Look at the documentation for [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) and look at their examples to see how they are building components.
