# Homework

1. (Est. 2 hours) Read about [advanced CSS selectors](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/complex-selectors/) and then practice by playing this [CSS selector game](https://flukeout.github.io/). It gets hard at the end, but try your best!

2. Fork this repo and follow the instructions on the README - [https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/html-css-project](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/html-css-project)

3. You'll be put in groups of three. Over the next three weeks, you'll be asked to complete one of the [Starter Projects](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/group-projects#starter-projects) as a group.

(If you need help with Forking - then refer back to [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))

# Prepare for the next class

1. (Est. 4-5 hours) Complete the first three lessons in this course on [Responsive Web Design Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-web-design-fundamentals--ud893). You should complete **Why Responsive?**, **Starting Small** and **Building Up**. *Don't worry if you don't have a phone you can use for Remote Debugging. You can use the browser's Device Emulation instead.*
