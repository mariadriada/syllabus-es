# Homework

1. Finish the Katas and exercises in the project we've worked on [today](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises-tdd)

2. Follow this tutorial about [Debugging with Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/)

3. Register yourself on the Marc Littlemore's free [JavaScript Testing for Beginners](https://www.marclittlemore.com/courses/javascript-testing-beginners-course/?signup=cyf-course) course and work your way through the 7 lessons, which are delivered via a daily email. The course uses a Mocha/Chai framework, which is in common use within the web development industry. This will give you more TDD practice using a different approach to Jest, as well as more exposure to ES2015/ES6 JavaScript.

## Research

1. Research other module formats than CommonJS. What is AMD? What are ES6
modules and how do their differ from CommonJS?
1. What are other test frameworks for JavaScript?
1. More parts of the Jest (Jasmine) DSL than just `.toBe()`
