# Coding Standards and Best Practices

## General

* Indentation should be consistent

  * I.e. all files should use either tabs or spaces and the same width (e.g. 4
    characters)
  * Do not mix tabs and spaces

* Use one casing style

  * Usually:
    * camelCase for JavaScript
    * hyphen-case or camelCase for CSS
  * Do not mix casing styles e.g. let first_name = person.firstName;

* Test coverage should be sufficient
  * This should meet or exceed the configured threshold; if this isn't possible,
    explain why
* Comment code that might be difficult to understand...
  * ...but also consider simplifying complex code if at all possible. If you
    find that you're writing a lot of comments, then it's a good indicator that
    your code is too verbose and potentially overengineered

## JavaScript

* Variable and function names should be descriptive

  * E.g. `const actors = getActorsFromFilm(film);` is easier to understand than
    `const temp2 = doStuff(temp);`

* Keep functions as short as possible

  * If a function is longer than 15 lines, consider breaking it down into
    smaller functions

* Use variables if a literal value is repeated more than once
  * E.g. `console.log('Peter', 'Peter'.length);` -> `const name = 'Peter';
    console.log(name, name.length);`

## CSS

* Styles should be based upon class selectors where possible e.g. `.some-class`

  * Facilitates reuse

* **Don't** use ID-based selectors e.g. `#some-id`
* Avoid styling HTML element selectors directly, unless it's to remove default
  browser styling

* Avoid using style properties in JavaScript
  * E.g. `myElement.style.display = 'none';`
  * This results in styles that are difficult to reuse
  * Use `Element.prototype.classList` instead e.g.
    `myElement.classList.add('hidden');`

## Git

* Make small, frequent commits

  * If you make a mistake, then it's easier to revert than if you only make
    large, occasional commits

* Avoid committing commented-out code
  * If the code exists in a previous commit, then use GitHub or `git diff` to
    view it
