--- /api/customers/ -- give example in notes /api/customers/1

--- Talk to Kash abobut deleting non-API endpoints on cyf-hotel-db (confusing)

--- customers/search/:surname -- clarify that :surname is supposed to be replaced with an actual surname.

--- break down exercise on POST -- or go through it. .run() should be demonsrtated in front of the class before asking them to do it.
