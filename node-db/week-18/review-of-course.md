# REVIEW OF COURSE

Potential improvements for next course (teacher's perspective):

- Teach students about ISO dates (use 9/11/2001 11/9/2001 as an example for why it can be confusing).
- Make sure escaping is taught correctly.
- Make sure foreign keys are done with sqlite using PRAGMA from the outset.
- Format : in future do lesson, followed by exercise, followed by stretch exercise so faster students don't get bored.
- Make sure installing and setting up and doing most basic exercise combining node and SQL is done on homework time.
- Getting students into the "write sql", "delete .sqlite file" and "run sql" and inspect should be done on homework time
- Put everything on trello up front and keep track.
- trello for "I'm done on exercise"
- date started -> check in date
- we need to actually mark the homework and help people who get it wrong.
- Explicitly show the difference between arbitrary and random on order by.
- flesh out examples on group by.
- make the exercises more specific.
- on 

arbitrary: 

- consistent ordering on computer A
- consistent ordering that is different on computer B
- consistent ordering on computer A that is different to what it was before.

random:

- show random 1, random 2
