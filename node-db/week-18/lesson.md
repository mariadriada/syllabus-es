### LESSON 1: JOIN ME, AND TOGETHER WE CAN RULE THE GALAXY AS FATHER AND SON!

So far, we've put data in tables and kept references to each of them using IDs, but
we've not yet learned how to link them automatically.

We don't know how to get the *name* of a customer from a reservation - only their ID.

Now let's say we want to get the *names* of customers who have a reservation *today*.

From what we know now, we *could* do it like this:

- `SELECT customer_id FROM reservations WHERE check_in_date = '2018/08/19';`
- write down the list of customer IDs on paper (e.g. 3, 5, 7)
- `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id IN (3, 5, 7);`

However, we want the computer to figure out that we want IDs 3, 5 and 7 by itself.

This is what a database "JOIN" is. In real life, if you work with databases, you will be using this thing *all* of the time - relationships between data are vitally important.

Now, we have data that spans two tables - we have reservations with a "customer_id" column that refers to the ID column in the "customers" table.

```sql
SELECT reservations.check_in_date, customers.first_name, customers.surname
FROM reservations JOIN customers ON reservations.customer_id = customers.id
WHERE reservations.check_in_date = '2018/08/19';
```

Note that:

- Because we are selecting columns from two tables and need to distinguish them, we use "table.column" syntax.
- We explicitly link reservations.customer_id and customers.id *even if they have a foreign key relationship*.
- reservations.customer_id and customers.id don't actually *have* to have a foreign key relationship, but they should.

Let's try the query.

First, go to the `cyf-hotel-db` repo in your terminal and switch to the `class3` branch. Next, run `npm i` and `npm start` to start the server. Then, open a new terminal tab in the `cyf-hotel-db` directory and run `sqlite3 database/database.sqlite` to open SQLite.

Now, copy and paste the above `SELECT` query into SQLite. You should get this:

```
2018/08/19|Marie|Niki
2018/08/19|Anna|Kolen
```


##### EXERCISE 1.a

Get the list of all room IDs together with their room type names.

##### EXERCISE 1.b: OPTIONAL STRETCH GOAL

Get the list of reservations (all columns) together with the the title, first name and surname customer who made it.



### LESSON 2: SQL INJECTION

So, our hotel has a shady new guest. Let's say that we have a react frontend on top which uses the
APIs we're building - users won't use the APIs directly but they can just fire up postman and use them
if they want.

This is very common - lots of websites have a single page application that uses an API underneath just like the one
we're building.

Now, this guest does a little poking around and he realizes that he can delete his reservation.

```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/reservations/6
```

Now, open a new terminal window and run "sqlite3 databases/database.sqlite":

```
sqlite> SELECT * FROM reservations;
```

The reservation with ID 6 should be deleted - as you coded it to work.

This is fine, but not very interesting. However, let's experiment - try doing *this* with your reservation API:

```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/reservations/6%20or%201%3D1
```

And run this again:

```
sqlite> SELECT * FROM reservations;
```

And voila, he's just emptied out the entire hotel. Nobody has a reservation any more!

### LESSON 3: ORDER BY SOMETHING

QUESTION FOR CLASS : What the difference is between *random* and *arbitrary*?

Up until now we've not been returning results in a *random* order, but we have been returning
them in an *arbitrary* order. The database has chosen what order to return records in. It's
generally the order you put them in but there is *no* guarantee it will be in that order.

Using 'order by' we can get records back in a specified order:

```sql
SELECT reservations.check_in_date, customers.first_name, customers.surname
FROM reservations JOIN customers ON reservations.customer_id = customers.id
WHERE reservations.check_in_date = '2018/08/19' ORDER BY customers.surname;
```

This will give the output in a new order:

```
2018/08/19|Anna|Kolen
2018/08/19|Marie|Niki
```

We have Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump and Mr Hackerman staying at the hotel. What order will the reservations be displayed in?

If we want to get *explicitly* the three of them in ascending order:

```sql
SELECT reservations.check_in_date, customers.first_name, customers.surname
FROM reservations JOIN customers ON reservations.customer_id = customers.id
WHERE reservations.check_in_date = '2018/08/19' ORDER BY customers.surname ASC;
```

Now, if we want them in descending order:

```sql
SELECT reservations.check_in_date, customers.first_name, customers.surname
FROM reservations JOIN customers ON reservations.customer_id = customers.id
WHERE reservations.check_in_date = '2018/08/19' ORDER BY customers.surname DESC;
```

```
Check In Date  First Name  Surname
------------------------------------
2018/08/19     Melania     Trump
2018/08/19     Donald      Trump
2018/08/19     Colm        Hackerman
2018/08/19     Bill        Clinton
2018/08/19     Hillary     Clinton
```

This is just one way the results could come out. They could also come out (e.g. on a different computer, or done at a different time), for instance, like this:

```
Check In Date  First Name  Surname
------------------------------------
2018/08/19     Donald      Trump
2018/08/19     Melania     Trump
2018/08/19     Colm        Hackerman
2018/08/19     Hillary     Clinton
2018/08/19     Bill        Clinton
```

Note that Donald and Melania and Bill and Hillary are both reversed this time. This is because we said to sort by surname, which it does, but there are no guarantees about what order rows appear in where the surname is the same.

So, if we want to make it more *deterministic* (opposite of arbitrary), we can make it sort by surname *first* and first name *second*:

```sql
SELECT reservations.check_in_date, customers.first_name, customers.surname
FROM reservations JOIN customers ON reservations.customer_id = customers.id
WHERE reservations.check_in_date = '2018/08/19' ORDER BY customers.surname DESC, customers.first_name ASC;
```

```
Check In Date  First Name  Surname
------------------------------------
2018/08/19     Donald      Trump
2018/08/19     Melania     Trump
2018/08/19     Colm        Hackerman
2018/08/19     Bill        Clinton
2018/08/19     Hillary     Clinton
```

In this case, since we're ordering by first name ascending, Donald always comes before Melania (D comes before M in the alphabet) and Bill comes before Hillary (because B comes before H in the alphabet).


### LESSON 4: LIMIT YOUR QUERIES

Now, the database you're working with right now is essentially just a toy. However,
when you work with a real database you're often going to have a number of problems

1) SELECT * FROM table is going to return thousands of rows. This take ages
to load and display and if you just want to see a representative sample it's overkill.

2) You want to return the top 10 of something.

3) You want to show results 1-10 on page 1, results 2-20 on page 2, etc.

SQL has a keyword called "LIMIT" which you can put at the end of a query to cut down
on the number of returned rows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY surname ASC LIMIT 2;
```

##### EXERCISE 4.a

Select two rooms only.


##### Exercise 4.b: OPTIONAL STRETCH GOAL

Select the latest 5 reservations on the database.


##### Exercise 4.c: OPTIONAL STRETCH GOAL

Select the reservations, primarily selecting the most recent ones, and secondarily selecting the longest ones.


### LESSON 5: DISTINCT

Remember the JOIN query from above? We're going to do another similar one.

```sql
SELECT customers.first_name, customers.surname
FROM reservations JOIN customers ON reservations.customer_id = customers.id
WHERE reservations.check_in_date > '2017/12/31' ORDER BY customers.surname ASC;
```

QUESTION FOR CLASS : What does this do?

ANS : Get a list of all customers who have a reservation that begins this year

Now, this is going to work with one exception. The list in my database
is going to look a bit like this:

```
First Name  Surname
---------------------
Hillary     Clinton
Colm        Hackerman
Colm        Hackerman
Colm        Hackerman
Donald      Trump
```

QUESTION FOR CLASS : Why?

ANS : Because Mr Hackerman loves this hotel more than Hillary and Donald and has arranged to stay there a few times.

Of course, we only want to know *IF* Hackerman has stayed there once, not that he's their most popular guest.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT customers.first_name, customers.surname
FROM reservations JOIN customers ON reservations.customer_id = customers.id
WHERE reservations.check_in_date > '2017/12/31' ORDER BY customers.surname ASC;
```

Will output:

```
First Name  Surname
---------------------
Hillary     Clinton
Colm        Hackerman
Donald      Trump
```

Problem solved.


##### EXERCISE 5.a

Get the list of check in dates in the summer 2017.


##### EXERCISE 5.b: OPTIONAL STRETCH GOAL

Get the list of customers that made a reservation in the last year, including their details.


### LESSON 6: SUM, AVERAGE AND COUNT

Let us imagine that we want to know how many reservations we have on our database. Similarly to the previous lesson, we could get all the records and count them ourselves, but that sounds boring and unrealistic in real life cases, where databases can have several millions of entries. So, for that purpose we have aggregation functions:

```
COUNT, SUM or AVG
```

The usages of each are pretty obvious.
So, this means that we can count, sum and calculate the average of a set of values.

Let's check an example for `COUNT`:

`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;`

This will return the number of customers on a database.

We call these aggregation functions, and we use them to modify the results while aggregating the table results - we had a list of rows for customers, now we have the count of customers: we aggregated the rows by counting them.


##### EXERCISE 6.a

COUNT the number of reservations for a given customer ID.


##### EXERCISE 6.b: OPTIONAL STRETCH GOAL

Calculate the average paid amount across all invoices.



### LESSON 7: GROUPING
Let us say that we need to get the list of different surnames from our list of customers, and how many times each surname shows up on our database.

Here the idea is that we could group the columns by the surname and get a list of each different surname, and then we can apply an aggregation function to them.

For this we can use `GROUP BY` as follows:

```sql
SELECT <column_to_aggregate_1>, <column_to_aggregate_2> FROM <table> GROUP BY <column_to_aggregate_1>, <column_to_aggregate_2>;
```

For instance, if we have the following entries on the customers:

| id | title | first_name | surname | email |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1|Doc.|Tom|Jones|tom.jones@domain.com|
|2|Mr.|Jorge|Silva|jorge-silva@domain.com|
|3|Mr.|Jorge|Silva|jorge2-silva@domain.com|
|16|Doc.|Pedro|Silva|pedro.silva@domain.com|
|17|Doc.|Colm|O'Conner|colm.oconner@domain.com|
|18|Doc.|James|Lennon|john.lennon@domain.com|
|19|Sir.|John|O'Conner|John.oconner@domain.com|

If we group by surname we have 4 different surnames: `O'Conner`, `Silva`, `Jones`, `Lennon`, but for `Silva` and `O'Conner`, we have more than one entry, so we need to aggregate them. In this case, we want to count the occurrences so we can simply do:

```sql
SELECT surname, COUNT(*) FROM customers GROUP BY surname;
```

This should give this output:

```
Jones|1
Silva|3
O'Conner|2
Lennon|1
```


##### EXERCISE 7.a

COUNT the occurrences of the DIFFERENT titles on the database.


##### EXERCISE 7.b: OPTIONAL STRETCH GOAL

COUNT the occurrences of a combination of first-name and surname to get a list of customers with the same name.



### LESSON 8: HAVING YOUR TABLE AND EATING IT

Suppose that we want to filter the result of what we got on the previous example - count of each customer's surname - to select only the surnames for which there are 3 or more customers?

To accomplish that we can use `HAVING` as follows:
```sql
SELECT surname, COUNT(*) AS count FROM customers GROUP BY surname HAVING count >= 3;
```

Note that `WHERE` would not work, because it enables us to filter data that will grouped, and we want to filter the result of that grouping. We want to filter by the count of customers.


##### EXERCISE 8.a

Get the list of customers that have 5 or more reservations on our hotel.
