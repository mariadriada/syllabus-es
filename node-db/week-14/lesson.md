## Middleware

One of the most powerful features of [Express](https://expressjs.com) compared to other node frameworks like [Hapi](https://hapijs.com/) is that it is middleware oriented.

Middleware in Express can be used to process all the requests that come through your application. For example, let's imagine that you wanted to log every request

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

const myLogger = (req, res, next) => {
  const visitTime = new Date();
  console.log(`visited ${req.url} at ${visitTime.toLocaleString()}`);
  next();
};

app.use(myLogger);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!");
});
```

As you can imagine it can be very useful to [write your own Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html), but you can also find [many useful middleware](https://github.com/rajikaimal/awesome-express#middleware) to add to your program for rapid development.

## Workshop

Fork and Clone the [express-workshop-2](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/express-workshop-2) repository

Let's have a look at the repo we've just forked.

* **Package.json**: Remember how in the last lesson we added a _package.json_
  file and added dependencies like _express_ to it.

  * What command did we use to create a _package.json_ file
  * How did we add dependencies to it?

  Today, the project comes with a package file already - this lists all the
  packages we need to run the project (instead of adding installed packages to
  the Git repo, which would take up a lot of memory, we just declare a list of
  dependencies in `package.json`). Now, we can run `npm install`, and the
  dependencies will be installed.

* **Server.js** - this is the entry point for our application. Let's walk
  through the code and remember what it does.
  * What is **Express Static Middleware** used for?
  * What routes are defined?
  * What **Port** does the server run on?

Let's run the server and check it in the browser. This is what you should see on your browser:

![](../assets/blog-screenshot.png)

* The theme used for this website is based on Bootstrap. You can get more open
  source Bootsrap-based themes from
  [StartBootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/)

> **Exercise**: Notice how the link to **Contact me** doesn't return a page -
> Let's add an endpoint to return a simple string **this is a contact page**.

## Templating

Once you have forked the repository, let's take a look at using templates

> **Exercise**: Let's change the text displayed in the browser for the link, **Contact me**, to **Contact Information**.

> How many files do you have to change? Wouldn't be nice if we could change one file and that reflects in all pages.

At the moment, we're just serving static HTML files from the _public_ folder.
**NodeJS** and **ExpressJS** allows us to build dynamic web pages.

> A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled
> by an application server that processes server-side scripts. In server-side
> scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page
> proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.

## Template Engines

A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application.
At **runtime**, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with
actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client.
This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page, as it reduces duplicate
code ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)).

Some popular template engines that work with Express are **Pug**, **Mustache**,
and **EJS**.

## Handlebars Templating Engine

We will use [Handlebars](https://github.com/ericf/express-handlebars) as the
templating engine for this class.

To add it to your project: `npm install --save express-handlebars`

Then in your `server.js`, we need to configure the `middleware` for Handlebars.

```js
// Add this to the top of your file
const exphbs = require("express-handlebars");

// Then these two lines after you initialise your express app
app.engine("handlebars", exphbs({ defaultLayout: "main" }));
app.set("view engine", "handlebars");
```

> Let's look at the folder `views/layouts/main.handlebars`

* There is a **placeholder for body** where the "body" get injected - can you
  find it?
* Notice the _index.handlebars_, _my-cv.handlebars_ and _admin.handlebars_.

Then add these routes:

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("index");
});
```

> **Exercise**: Add similar endpoints for `/my-cv` and `/admin`.

> **Exercise**: Let's create a template called `contact` and delete the endpoint
> we created earlier for `/contact` - render a view instead - similar to what we
> did with the previous endpoints.

> **Exercise**: Remember how we changed **Contact** to **Contact Information**?
> Try to change now **Contact Information** to **Get in touch**. Was it any
> easier?

## Template passing info from Controller to Template

When we were using the _static_ HTML pages from _public/_ folder - the heading
text shown on top of the page (on the photo) used to change when we go to
different pages. Now that we switched to the template, we've lost that behavior
as the code for this part comes from the centralised **Layout**
(views/layouts/main.handlebars).

How can we imitate that behavior without having to duplicate code or serve
static files? **Express** and **Handlebars** allow you to pass data between the
**routes** and the **views**. Here is how we can do it:

1. Let's modify the `/` route to pass the title of the page.

   ```js
   app.get("/", (req, res) => {
     res.render("index", {
       title: "Etzali Profile" // insert your name instead
     });
   });
   ```

2. In `/views/layouts/main.handlebars`, let's use the data we're passing to the
   template

   ```html
   <div class="row">
       <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
           <div class="site-heading">
               <!-- Notice the change in the next line -->
               <h1>{{title}}</h1>
               <hr class="small">
               <span class="subheading">A modern Website built in Node</span>
           </div>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```

> **Exercise**: Pass the `subheading` from the route to the view as well.

> **Exercise**: Change Title to default to "My Profile" if no title was
> provided. Look at #if helpers for Handlebars
> http://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html

## Partials

Handlebars allows for template reuse through partials. Partials are normal
Handlebars templates that may be called directly by other templates.
([Handlebars documentation](http://handlebarsjs.com/partials.html))

Let's put the **Menu** in a partial.

1. Go to `layout/main.handlebars` and cut the `<nav>` with all its contents, and
   move it to a new file called `menu.handlebars` under `views/partials`.

Then to use the partial, add `{{> menu}}` in the place where you cut the
original menu from.

## More Templating

There is much more that can be done with **Handlebars** templating engine. Skim
through the [express-handlebars](https://github.com/ericf/express-handlebars)
and [handlebars documentation](handlebarsjs.com)

For now, we will finish by using the **each** helper.

### Dynamically loading the templates

```html
{{#each posts}}
    <div class="post-preview">
        <a href="post.html">
            <h2 class="post-title">
                {{this.title}}
            </h2>
            <h3 class="post-subtitle">
                {{this.summary}}
            </h3>
        </a>
    </div>
{{/each}}
```

In the `route`, let's load the file in `data/posts.json`:

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  const filePath = __dirname + "/data/posts.json";
  const callbackFunction = (error, file) => {
    // we call .toString() to turn the file buffer to a String
    const fileData = file.toString();
    // we use JSON.parse to get an object out the String
    const postsJson = JSON.parse(fileData);
    // send the json to the Template to render
    res.render("index", {
      title: "Etzali Profile", // insert your name instead
      posts: postsJson
    });
  };
  fs.readFile(filePath, callbackFunction);
});
```

# Callbacks

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. That means they can be used in
a first class manner like any other object since they are objects themselves. We
can pass them as arguments to functions which is common technique in JavaScript
for dealing with **asynchronous** behaviour. We have in fact already encountered
callbacks when we looked at array methods such as `.forEach()`, `.map()` and
`.filter()`.

```js
const evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];
evenNumbers.forEach(num => {
  console.log(num);
});
```

Here we are passing the `function (num) { console.log(num); }` function as an
argument to `.forEach()` to execute with each item in the array `evenNumbers`.

The above example is **synchronous** which means that code the callback is
executed immediately. Let's look at an example where the code is executed
**asynchronously**. We will use a `setTimeout` function to delay execution here.
In most JavaScript applications asynchronous code execution could be in response
to an event such as mouse click or data coming back from a server. We will look
at both of those cases in detail in a future class.

```js
function delay(callback) {
  setTimeout(callback, 2000);
}

function logRandom() {
  const value = Math.round(Math.random() * 10);
  console.log(value);
  return value;
}

delay(logRandom);
```

**Key points**

* Functions can be passed as arguments to other other function
* Functions that are passed as arguments are called **callbacks**
* Callbacks may be executed immediately or later
* If a callback is executed later, its return value is lost

> **Exercise**: What other Asynchronous operations have we recently used in the
> Node code we've written?

> **Exercise**: On the CV page, there is a button, **Get Repos List**, that
> doesn't work. There is code to make it work at `js\github-client.js`. Add
> `js\github-client.js` to your pages.

The **client-side code** in _github-client.js_ should look familiar.

> **Exercise**: Identify all the callbacks in this code. Refactor the
> **anonymous functions** to their own variables and use the variables instead.
> (Bonus point if you use arrow functions)

## Callback hell

In the code where we retrieve the repos data from Github, imagine if we had a
requirement, that for each repo retrieved, we have to make another API call to
retrieve all the available branches (there is a property called _branches_url_
that we can use to get that info). And then, once we have all the branches, make
_another_ API call to get the info for each branch.

The code to do so, will look something similar to this:

```js
var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
oReq.addEventListener("load", function() {
  var oReq2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
  oReq2.addEventListener("load", function() {
    var oReq3 = new XMLHttpRequest();
    oReq2.addEventListener("load", function() {
      // 4. Now we finally have all the info we need and we can the info we retrieved from the three API calls.
    });
    oReq3.open("GET", BRANCH_INFO_URL); // 3. third url for branch info
    oReq3.send();
  });
  oReq.open("GET", BRANCH_URL); // 2. second url for branches
  oReq.send();
});
oReq.open("GET", REPO_URL); // 1. first url for Repo
oReq.send();
```

The code above is very hard to understand and follow. Notice the pyramid shape
`})` - This is often called the **callback hell**.

# APIs

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for applications to
communicate with each other. We already consumed an API earlier in the day:
**Github API**. We managed to _communicate_ with Github and get important
information. We - the client - can use this information in a number of different
ways. Our client, in this case, is a Web page but it could have easily been a
Mobile Application, or a TV setbox etc...

> **Let's** watch this video about APIs -
> [What is an API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY)

> **Exercise**: Let's expose the `posts.json` as an API for other clients to
> consume through the url `/api/get-posts`. Hint: make use `res.sendFile`

## REST API

[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) (REpresentational State Transfer) and RESTful APIs provide a convention and architecture for building APIs that is simple and scalable.

There are many constraints and aspects to building a REST API, but one
fundamental constraint is the use of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and HTTP
Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc..)

In our _endpoint_ that we just created `/api/get-posts`, the _get_ part of the
URL is redundant as the HTTP Method `GET` already tells that we are _GETting_ a
_Resource_. The Resource in this case is called **posts**.

> Exercise: Let's rename our endpoint to `/posts` so that it follows RESTful
> architecture.
>
> **What would the endpoint for creating posts be called?**

> **Watch**: [What is a REST API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA)
> (up to 3 minutes)

REST is a big topic that we will revisit again. The table below from Wikipedia
shows how a typical RESTful API would look like.

![](../assets/REST.png)
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Uniform_interface)

For now, remember when building APIs, to use **Resource** names to identify your
endpoints and make use of the **HTTP methods (Verbs)** to describe operations
performed on those resources.

# Deploying to Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that lets companies build,
deliver, monitor, and scale apps. Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and
scale modern apps. Heroku is fully managed, giving developers the freedom to
focus on their core product without the distraction of maintaining servers,
hardware, or infrastructure.

1. [Signup for an account](https://signup.heroku.com/) on Heroku
   * It will send a verification to your email so make sure you've entered a
     valid email
1. Download the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)
1. We need to do a small tweak to our app to be ready to be deployed on Heroku.

On server.js, add the `process.env.PORT` bit of code

```js
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function() {
  console.log("Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!");
});
```

This tells our server to look for an **environment variable** called `PORT` and
use it to run the server, otherwise use Port 3000. When the server runs on
heroku, then Heroku sets the `PORT` to the correct value.

`git add` and `commit` your change.

4. Now open the command line in the folder where you have your
   **express-workshop** repo running. If you run the command `git remote -v`,
   you should see one remote **origin** pointing to your repo.

Run these commands:

`heroku login`

> This will ask you for your heroku email and password that you used to
> register.

Once you're logged in:

`heroku create`

> The heroku create command creates a new application on Heroku – along with a
> git remote that must be used to receive your application source.

If you check `git remote -v`, you should see a second remote called **heroku**.

Now push your code to heroku `git push heroku master`. The push will run few
commands from Heroku, then you should see a url similar to
`https://some-random-name-XXXX.herokuapp.com` - go to the URL and if all goes
well, your app should be up and running.
