## Node Recap

Javascript has evolved from the browser to be used in the backend. It does not need a framework as we saw in [week-13](../week-13/lesson.md), however a framework like Express allows us to develop faster.

### Documentation

When you are working with frameworks it is always helpful to use their documentation.

* [Express Documentation](https://expressjs.com)
* [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)

### Middleware

Middleware allow us to process requests to add functionalities that are not built in to Express, for example logging, authentication, etc.

> * Express Documentation: [Using Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)
> * Video: [body-parser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKlybue_yMQ) which makes it easier to work with POST requests and forms.

### Routing

Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to the client requests. These are configured differently for each framework, and can range from basic configuration to very extensive for more complex use cases.

Simple example

```js
app.get("/", function(req, res) {
  res.send("hello world");
});
```

More complicated example using `Passport.js` middleware for authentication

```js
function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) return next();
  else res.redirect("/login");
}

app.get("/account", ensureAuthenticated, function(req, res) {
  res.send("welcome user!");
});
```

## Best Practices

Express have their own recommended [best practices page](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html)

## Node Process Managers

These process managers monitor for any changes in your node.js application and automatically restart the server, perfect for development and production.

> Popular PMs include:

> * [pm2](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/pm.html#pm2)

## REST

REST is a convention of how to design your API, whether it is for your own frontend, or other frontends and clients.

## Security

When you take your website to production there is a whole range of things to consider.

![HTTP vs HTTPS](../assets/http-vs-https.png)

Node has built in support for HTTPS, and once you have your own certificates you can use this feature. However sometimes when you deploy to `cloud` Platform Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers such as Heroku, they provide SSL and configure it for you automatically.

> * Read: [Node: HTTPS](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html)
> * Read/Watch: [What is an SSL Certificate?](https://www.globalsign.com/en/ssl-information-center/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/)
> * Read: [Heroku SSL](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl)

## Authentication

Sometimes you need to add user functionality for your website. To do this you can make use of external libraries like [passport](www.passportjs.org) to add authentication to your website.

## Hotel Workshop

Get in to groups of 3/4 and checkout the [workshop brief](./workshop.html).

> **Exercise**: Please fork and clone [CYF-Hotel](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-hotel) repository and follow the exercises in the `README.MD`.
